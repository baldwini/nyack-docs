# River City
---
The largest city in the caverns of Nyack centred on a river that flows directly through it which is used for power and water. River city is well guarded with sets of walls surrounding its outer edges, armoured guards patrolling the outskirts and streets of the city, and checkpoints for new arrivals. These checkpoints act as screenings looking for obelisk related paraphernalia; if an arrival is found with any suspicious items they are taken to a holding facility for questioning and then are executed publicly. Most River City residents believe in the idea that the obelisk is an overly powerful that hates all that is not itself. The view the obelisk as a disgusting creature than a living and breathing organism. Furthermore, they believe that the obelisk creates psychopomps to unfairly bring the underworld's inhabitants. The city is the most advanced civilization in Nyack's depths having their own government, political hierarchies, common currency, and job market. Militia groups are sent out each day for gathering materials, destroying and hiding any related to the obelisk, and are brought back for the lottery. The lottery functions on an individual basis, the more specie someone puts in the more likely they are the first to choose from the resources each month. That individual may take whatever it is they can carry, while they leave the rest for the next person to take, until the pile runs dry.

# Mages

An isolationist, less fortified group that works closely with obelisk related materials who look for the answers about the skies above, which they don't see as a physical place but a different plane of existence. They systematically work towards the goal of figuring out the visions from the elder's past about the great skies, which was seen when working with obelisk material forty years before the player character's story begins. When they speak, they do so in the old tongue, using the language left by the old civilization. They generally understand the technology left behind however they don't have access to most of the old civilizations buildings, as they are inhabited by many of the obelisk's constructions. Their magic is born from the parts of the obelisk as well as it's creations; the typical process includes parts of an obelisk creation, components that represent a basic idea, and a long session of focus on that specific idea. During this process, curse gets emitted from the obelisk component, which is said to bring immensely poor luck to those surrounding it; typically a spell creator works alone to allow for concentration and so that curse isn't unnecessarily spread to others. A spell creationist, which is normally on the younger side and never an elder as they are exempt from spell creation, typically lives alone in fear of the curse's power to bring misfortune; the creationist unfortunately get replaced frequently. Thankfully, this immense luck will deplete over time. The mages tend to think of the obelisk as a frightening spirit that fears its neighbours as much as it neighbours fear her; that the obelisk creates so that she may defend herself. 

# Old Civilization
---
The old civilization lived in great interconnected corridors, where some rooms are unrecognizable of their original layout due to deterioration or damage from those who roam the halls currently, obelisk creations. Although many dangerous obelisk creatures still inhabit the halls other are fairly mundane and mimic what the old civilization may have done before their downfall. Many of the mundane obelisk creatures have existed and lived at the side of the old civilization, they were popularly treated as pets, servants, or helpers. The original inhabitants of the old civilization were notably larger than the player character and some rooms are confusing as to there purpose as they were much different creatures to those who live in the depths of Nyack today.

The old civilization had to purge negative emotions from their people; these feelings being recognized by the obelisk have been previously disastrous. They were required to police their own ideas to prevent obelisk enslavement.
