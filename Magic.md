# Spell Modifiers
---

## Binding
A modifier that dictates that the spell lasts for a set amount of time. Every spell has a specified amount of binding; the length of time could be a second, referred to as a single hit, to a week of time (about 105 minutes, as every day is fifteen minutes or 900 seconds).
## Ritual
Free costing spell's are rituals, they can be cast as many times as possible without expending health. These spells would take much longer to cast than any other spell and cannot be overly complex. Casting ritual spells will require [[Skills#Survival (INS-4)|survival]] checks.
## Area
A spell that effects are area on hit. These can be a few feet in diameter to miles long. Although, for the player's sake the range will be defined as **one foot to fifty feet**. Area spells that have binding are known as "auras."

# Spell Targets
---

## Target
A modifier that tells the spell what the target is supposed to be.

### Self Targeting
This target will be the caster's person.

### Missile
A modifier that tells the spell that it is a straight firing projectile outward from the player character to the player's cursor.

### Locking
A modifier indicating that the spell shoots from the player's character slowly to the player's cursor. The cursor can be moved to manipulate the spell's target.

### Command
A modifier that allows a spell to be cast at a location.

### Enchantment
A spell modifier that indicates that the spell is targeting an item for enhancement, which may have a duration. Objects with enchantments may require activation.

# Spell Definitions
---

## Mind
A spell that changes with a target's [[Relationship#Individual|state of mind]].

### Fear
The target will run from the caster. If the caster targets themselves with the spell they will be uncontrollable until the spell has worn off. A counter to the soothe spell type, negating it's effect.

### Soothe
Release anger in the target's mind, turn hostile non-player character's into neutral or sceptical characters. A counter to the fear spell type, negating it's effect; the target will not be soothed nor in a state of fear.

## Information

### Seek
Spell used to find nearby objects. It would only find anything on a target or area. A raw material would be needed during spell creation. For example, if you wanted to find keys, you would need to input a key during spell creation.

### Sense
A spell used for understanding target emotions. Most inhabitants of Nyack don't appreciate spell casters so it is unlikely they would be tolerant of the player casting spells on them.

### Identify
Used to identify unknown objects found in the player character's travels.

## Quality

### Aggrandize
Makes blades sharper and armour tougher.

### Mend
Repair an [[Equipment|item]], restore it's quality. Only usable if the item is broken.

# Casting Failure
---
The more spells that player has equipped or stored on their character gives them more curse, which leads to side effects and or full spell casting failure.
