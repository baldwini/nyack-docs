## Variables Determining Actions
---
The non-player characters in the game will have an extensive list of variables that are triggered by events or behaviours of other non-player characters. Each of which is random but contain modifiers to trend motivations down similar paths. Motivations are built in each character based on needs, wants, emotion and or physical statuses. Each of these motivations are defined by a variable or multiple variables.

## Motivations
---
Motivations are on a scale of -5 to 5, similar to the player's [[CharacterSheet/Attributes|attributes system]], where the positive values are over fulfilment while negative values are under fulfilment. Every motivational variables section must be completed in order of importance before the non-player character is allowed to act upon different sections. However, there is an exception to this rule, non-player characters are consistently being informed by the [[Non-player Character Variables#Preference|preference]] motivation about the ways they will take smaller, more inconsequential actions.

### Safety
Needs are separated among different categories that need fulfilment. If some or all of these categories are not met then the non-player character will strive to achieve them  based on the status outcomes.

- Sleep
	The sleep requirement should be met every fifteen minutes of real-time or each day in the game's time. The outcome of not receiving sleep will be the same as the [[StatusEffects|player's status effects]] and will attach a status outcome in accordance to the severity sleep missed.

### Status Outcomes
---
Status outcomes are the result of having missing or overwhelming fulfilment from an non-player characters motivations. These outcomes drive variable triggers, that in turn create event scenarios. Each level of a motivation may result in a status outcome or event trigger. Most event triggers will come from more important non-player characters.
