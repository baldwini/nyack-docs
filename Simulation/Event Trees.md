# Event Trees
---
The purpose of event trees are to provide the player with handcrafted quest lines or to create moments that demonstrate world reactivity. These event trees may be started by the player speaking to a specific non-player character, the player continuing down other event trees, automatically through non-player characters that are on a set timer, or a combination of these factors. The reason these exist is to show to the player that the world is not only reactive but may move and change on its own accord.

# Master Events
---
Master events are the starting point of an event tree, either the reason an event is triggering or the requirements for an event to trigger by non-player characters or the player. Every event tree will have a master event at the beginning even if an event is started way down the chain of events by the player, even if the player has not engaged in previous events.
