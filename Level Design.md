# World Design
---
World is made up of a web of linear segments that the player can choose from at locations in which they intersect. The player will be locked out of entering many of these segments without the right items or abilities; these segments will have to be revisited later after unlocking these new abilities. Sections that are unavailable to the player must be made clear to them so they donâ€™t spend unnecessary time trying to solve an unsolvable puzzle.

# World Variables
---
World Variables are global variables in the world that describe how a particular piece of the world behaves, in addition to the regularity at which particular events may occur. These variables will change throughout different locations in the game, as different zones may have different variables that factor into how the environment behaves, and how the player will have to react to things/solve puzzles. Below, we list some ideas for world variables, and what they would affect in the game environment:

- Location
A visual reading of where the player is in the world.
- Time
A clock that displays local time.
- Weather
Weather indicator that shows present and near future local weather reading.
- Curse
A display that shows the level of curse in a level segment, which triggers random events.
