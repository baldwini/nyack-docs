# Design Goals and Rules
---
1. References to our world must be vague, if a player doesn’t understand a reference to something made in the world and is confused by that, that makes the player feel out of a joke and breaks immersion.
2. The main narrative must service creativity into individual stories. The main narrative isn’t the main focus but a catalyst for small, easily consumable interactions and stories.
3. This is our first project, it doesn’t have to be perfect.

# What is the Nyack project?
---
An obelisk that cuts through the planet of Nyack awakens one day and releases myth, creatures that come from fairytales. The activation of the obelisk was triggered by a civilization that abandoned and thought their old cultures were foolish. Our player lands into the underworld where the aftermath of the activation has unfolded.
