# Design Goals and Rules
---
1. References to our world must be vague, if a player doesn’t understand a reference to something made in the world and is confused by that, that makes the player feel out of a joke and breaks immersion.
2. The main narrative must service creativity into individual stories. The main narrative isn’t the main focus but a catalyst for small, easily consumable interactions and stories.
3. This is our first project, it doesn’t have to be perfect.

# What is the Nyack project?
---
An obelisk that cuts through the planet of Nyack that replicates the emotions and actions of those who inhabit the planet. During the fall of the old civilization in the depths of Nyack the obelisk changes to reflect it, becoming more hostile and creating beasts that represent the old inhabitants. Our player lands into the underworld hundreds of years after the aftermath of the old civilization.
