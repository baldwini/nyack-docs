# Movement
---
The player is able to move in all directions and is affected by gravity. They have the option to walk or sprint. Sprint should have a toggleable option within game options. The player is able to jump and move vertically about half their height, one Unity unit, to reach areas across large gaps in the floor or to clamber small obstacles.

# Hands
---
 This houses the player's currently equipped spell (right hand) and item (left hand). The player will be able to hold both an item and a spell casting device (or free casting hand) at the same time.

# Backpack
---
The backpack holds all items the player picks up. There are set places for the items to be placed in the bag. Items can be pulled out of the bag into the player's hands and placed back into the bag. 

# Items
---
Items act as objects that tell the player about world variables or act as "keys" that unlock near level segments. All items physically exist within the world and will be seen on enemies, in their hands, and/or backpack. If the player can a non-player character has an item it will drop from them if the non-player character are disoriented or messed with.

# Magic
---
The player will have the ability to cast spells, limited to around four. These will affect the player, hostiles, non-player characters, and or the nearby environment. Each spell should have fairly versatile usage, allowing for each spell to act as two or three. For example, a fire spell should be used to create a fireball that can be held by the player to emit light, set object ablaze, or be thrown as a projectile.

We have a few different options for selection below:
- Casting spells individually with your cursor
- A UI that pops up on the screen that lets the player cycle through spells
