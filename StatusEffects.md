## Sleep Deprivation
Sleep is required to for the player to save the game; camps can be set up by the player to sleep outside towns. Different areas of the game will have protection levels based on distance from obelisk, nearby factions and towns, and the player's reputation with those towns or factions. These factors affect the difficulty of the [[Skills#Survival (INS-4)|Survival]] check, which is made every rest outside, if failed then a random encounter may begin. Failure to sleep will occasionally result in negative side effects for the player, growing based on how long the player hasn't slept.
