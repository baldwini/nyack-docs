# World Design
---
World is made up of a web of linear segments that the player can choose from at [[Locations|locations]] in which they intersect. The player will be locked out of entering many of these segments without the right items or abilities; these segments will have to be revisited later after unlocking these new abilities. Sections that are unavailable to the player must be made clear to them so they donâ€™t spend unnecessary time trying to solve an unsolvable puzzle.

# World Variables
---
World Variables are global variables in the world that describe how a particular piece of the world behaves, in addition to the regularity at which particular events may occur. These variables will change while standing in different locations in the game, as different zones may have different variables that factor into how the environment behaves, and how the player will have to react to things/solve puzzles. Below, there is a list some ideas for world variables, and what they would affect in the game environment:

- **Time**: A clock that displays local time.
- **Weather**: Weather indicator that shows present and near future local weather reading.
- **Curse**: A display that shows the level of curse in a level segment, which triggers random events.

# Targeted Player Characters
---
The game will need to be completable from start to finish with all of these play-styles and anything that might fall between them. Some side-quests may be more difficult for some classes however that is a given; the main narrative must be completable.

- **Thief**: A player character designed to run in and out of combat, steal items easily, wear the lightest armour variants, and typically has proficiency with light weapons.

- **Alchemist**: A player character designed to buff themselves, throw de-buffing and or damaging potions, wear a good mix of armours, and generally have some proficiency with simple weapons.

- **Fighter**: A player character designed to wear the heaviest of armours and wield the largest of weapons. This character is typically seen as the brute force character.

- **Mage**: A player character fully focused on spell-casting to solve problems and for combat. They typically do not focus on wearing armour that will weigh them down. They may have some proficiency with light weapons in case they run out of spells to cast.
