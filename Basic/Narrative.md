# Background
---
Old Age Civilization lived on the Planet of Nyack in the far past. As long as the civilization has existed, there has been a great Obelisk, once revered, then scorned. They progressed into a society similar to that seen in early science fiction novels, abandoning traditional ideals for the progression of science. During the collapse of the old civilization the obelisk mimicked it's downfall, creating myths that resembled negative emotions found in the heads of old civilization citizens. These creatures that defied reality assisted in the shattering of the old civilization, and the disparate parts split off and became small tribes that were beholden to the obelisk's myths, having to live side by side with the feared myths. Overtime, knowledge of the Old Age Civilization was lost, becoming itself a cautionary tale, and the scattered tribes of Nyack (New Age Civilization), rarely interact with outside tribes, or progress much at all, staying stagnate in fear. The obelisk cannot be stopped unfortunately as it is the only reason life can survive in the depths of the deep caverns of Nyack.
