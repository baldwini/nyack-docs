# Design Goals and Rules
---
1. References to our world must be vague, if a player doesn’t understand a reference to something made in the world and is confused by that, that makes the player feel out of a joke and breaks immersion.
2. The main narrative must service creativity into individual stories. The main narrative isn’t the main focus but a catalyst for small, easily consumable interactions and stories.
3. This is my first project, it doesn’t have to be perfect.

# What is the setting?
---
An obelisk that cuts through the planet of Nyack that replicates the emotions and actions of those who inhabit the planet. During the fall of the old civilization in the depths of Nyack the obelisk changes to reflect it, becoming more hostile and creating beasts that represent the old inhabitants. Our player lands into the underworld hundreds of years after the aftermath of the old civilization.

Don't stand under the obelisk.
# What is Nyack?
---
Nyack is a computer role-playing game inspired by the Generic Universal Role-playing System created by Steve Jackson, other old school renaissance tabletop games, late nineties role-playing video games, post-apocalyptic fantasy, and esoteric game design. Nyack isn't a full simulation game but takes advantage of simulation elements; if something is unrealistic but fun then it is heavily considered for the final build. The game's art is presented in a *Sehnsuct* manner, the feeling of yearning for something that feels like a ideal alternative of the past; the visual look of what a late 1990's computer role-playing game would look like to those without the context of more realistic graphical advancements made over the next twenty-something years.
