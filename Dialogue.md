# Dialogues
---
Player driven text boxes that allow for multiple outcomes depending on choices.

These should be used to learn more about the world on the player's volition, for the player to take quests, and to make quest related decisions. Any time a dialogue is used it should try to accomplish something that a bark can't do.

# Barks
---
Small blurbs of text that appear over non-player characters heads

These are traditionally used to give background about the world or location, show current problems and potential quests, and great for showing humour. Any text that doesn't need to be in a larger context that shows the everyday life of an non-player character.

# Written Actions
---
Text boxes that the player is locked into until they make a choice about something that game can't show with its already existing mechanics.

These would be used for anything the game doesn't need as a button press. Anytime the player wants to do something outside of the context of the controls and existing mechanics this should be used.

# Text Modifiers
---
These are modifiers added onto text based on the player or non-player character's current status effect. These will be procedural additions to speech.
## Low Intelligence
If the player and or non-player character has low intelligence then there will be many awkward spacing and conjunctions will be taken out. Interjections will be added to show emotion.

## Language Barrier
If the player doesn't understand the language of a non-player character then many words will become garbled. More complex words will be replaced with incomprehensible collections of random letters instead.

## Intoxication
If a player and or non-player character is intoxicated then some words will become capitalized and pronounced. Some speech may also become interrupted with pauses, represented by ellipses, or belches.

**Example**: The road to Riv Nowt gets dangerous at this time, I suggest you take a rest. My home is open to you but I'd like you to leave before the 18th spin of tomorrow.

The road to... *uuh* Riv Nowt gets *ummh* DANGEROUS at this time, I suggest you... take a rest. MY HOME is open to you but *-eeerrp* I'd like you to leave before the 18TH spin of tomorrow.
