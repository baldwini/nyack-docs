[[Attributes#Strength|Strength]] requirements for wearing different armours
Each attribute score away from STR is a movement speed & swing speed penalty of 33%
Some armours may have innate speed penalties

Armors have Damage Resistance and Damage Negation values
Damage values first get subtracted by DN then multiplied by decimal percentages
Armour will have DR and DN for each type of damage (Pierce, Bludgeon, Slash, Fire, Electric, etc.)

Example:
Bronze Helm DR 40% / DN 5
Raw Damage - DN = X / DR = Actual Damage

Armors are separated into different segments based on armor types
Some pieces only provide defense of Arm Left, Arm Right, Leg Left, Leg Right, Torso, Head, Hand Left, Hand Right, Foot Left, Foot Right
Some pieces provide defense to multiple areas, an example would be Leg Left/Leg Right
Pieces of armor will have their own individual weights
