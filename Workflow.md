# 3D Modeling
---
1. Keep vertices aligned on the voxel grid while maintaining one pixel per 0.063 meters. (Each locked unit in Blender represents one pixel long)
2. Stray from using “voxel” looking structures and props, don’t refrain from creating interesting shapes and angles.
3. Keep models relative to the size of the player capsule.
4. Unwrap based on Cube Projection, might require tweaking for more complex/higher polygon count objects.
